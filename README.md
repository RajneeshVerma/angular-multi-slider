## Submitting an issue

Please be responsible, the open source community is not there to guess your problem or to do your job. When submitting an issue try as much as possible to:

1. search in the already existing issues or on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ngtable?sort=newest&pageSize=30) if your issue has not been raised before.

2. give a precise description mentionning angular version, ng-table version.

3. give a way to reproduce your issue, the best would be with a <strong>running example</strong>, you can use [plunkr](http://plnkr.co/), or [codepen](http://codepen.io/). **Tip:** See below for a list of base codepen's you can fork

4. isolate your code sample on the probable issue to avoid pollution and noise.

5. Close your issue when a solution has been found (and share it with the community)

Note that 80% of the open issues are actually not issues but "problem" due to developpers laziness or lack of investigation. These "issues" are a waste of time for us and especially if we have to setup a sample to reproduce the issue which those developpers could have done. Any open issue which does not fulfill this contract will be closed without investigation.
